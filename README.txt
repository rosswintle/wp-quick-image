It's like the "Quick Draft" dashboard widget, but for images!

== Description ==

*It's like the "Quick Draft" dashboard widget, but for images!*

Provides a simple dashboard widget that allows you to easily post images.  Posted images are set as the featured image of the created post, but are not, currently, included in the post content.

This is a first-stab at this functionality.  It works but needs more features to be really useful. I plan to develop it more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-quick-image` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Alternatively you can upload `wp-quick-image.zip` from Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I use this? =

I developed this because I wanted to post image-only posts to my blog, and set that image as the featured image, which makes use of theme features that display featured images.

It's also great for posting images to Facebook. If you use a pluign like Yoast's WordPress SEO then you can automatically have OpenGraph data generated for posts and you can post images on your blog to Facebook, without ever uploading them to Facebook!

= Why don't you use post formats? =

Because the future of post formats seems a little uncertain and not all themes support them. I'll be adding options for the plugin in future, and this may be one of them.

= Why don't you include the image in the post content? =

Mostly because the theme I use displays the featured image really nicely and so this isn't needed. An option to include the image in the post content may be added later.

= Can I post to a specific category/tag? =

No. This is an option that I plan to add in future.

= Can I post as a draft?

No, but again, this is an option I plan to add in future.
